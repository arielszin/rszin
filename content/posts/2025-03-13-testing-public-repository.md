# Testing Public Repository

This is a test post to verify that our public repository setup is working correctly. After making our repository public, we want to ensure that the deployment process still works smoothly.

## What We've Done

1. Simplified the build script
2. Updated the repository structure
3. Made the repository public
4. Created this test post

## Benefits of a Public Repository

Having a public repository offers several advantages:

- **Transparency**: Others can see how the site is built
- **Collaboration**: Makes it easier for others to contribute
- **Simplicity**: Simplified deployment process
- **Learning**: Others can learn from our code

## Next Steps

Now that we have a public repository, we can:

1. Continue adding content to the site
2. Improve the design and functionality
3. Accept contributions from others
4. Share our work with the community

This post confirms that everything is working as expected with our new public repository setup.
